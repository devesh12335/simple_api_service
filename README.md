A Simple, Robust API Service for Dart
=====================================

A robust Dart package for managing API calls with a built-in request queue, unified responses, and flexible error handling.

Core Features
-------------

‚öôÔ∏è

### Singleton Pattern

Ensures one and only one instance of the service, providing a single, global point of access to your API client.

üö¶

### Request Queuing

Automatically processes API calls sequentially, preventing race conditions and simplifying state management.

‚ö†Ô∏è

### Custom Error Handling

A flexible \`ErrorHandler\` callback allows you to implement app-wide error logic in one central place.

üì¶

### Unified API Response

All calls return a consistent \`ApiResponse\` object, simplifying how you handle success, failure, and data.

Installation
------------

Get started by adding the package to your \`pubspec.yaml\` file and running \`dart pub get\`.

    dependencies:
      simple_api_service: ^0.0.1
